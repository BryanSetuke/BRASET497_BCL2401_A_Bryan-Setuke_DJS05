# Redux-Inspired Tally App Store

## Overview
This project implements a minimalistic, Redux-inspired store to manage and log the state of a counting Tally App. The store supports actions to increment, decrement, and reset the counter, and logs state changes to the console.

## How to Run the Code
1. Ensure you have a modern web browser installed.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Open the browser console to observe the state changes.

## Approach
The approach for this project was to create a Redux-inspired state management system from scratch. The key components include:
- **Store Implementation**: The store is created using the `createStore` function, which manages the state, dispatches actions, and allows subscriptions to state changes.
- **State Management**: The state is managed by a reducer function that handles `INCREMENT`, `DECREMENT`, and `RESET` actions.
- **Functional Programming**: The code adheres to functional programming principles, using pure functions and immutability to ensure predictable state management.

### Action Definitions (action.js)
Defined action types for incrementing, decrementing, and resetting the counter.
```javascript
export const actionTypes = {
    INCREMENT: "INCREMENT",
    DECREMENT: "DECREMENT",
    RESET: "RESET"
};
```

### Initial State (initialState.js)
Defined the initial state of the application.
```javascript
export const initialState = {
    count: 0,
};
```

### Reducer Function (reducer.js)
Implemented the reducer function to update the state based on actions.
```javascript
import { actionTypes } from './action.js';
import { initialState } from './initialState.js';

export function reducer(state = initialState, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case actionTypes.INCREMENT:
            return { count: state.count + 1 };
        case actionTypes.DECREMENT:
            return { count: state.count - 1 };
        case actionTypes.RESET:
            return { count: 0 };
        default:
            return state;
    }
}
```

### Store Implementation (store.js)
Created a simple store with `dispatch`, `getState`, and `subscribe` methods.
```javascript
export function createStore(reducer) {
    let state = reducer(undefined, {});
    const listeners = [];

    return {
        // Dispatch an action to update the state
        dispatch(action) {
            state = reducer(state, action);
            listeners.forEach(listener => listener());
        },
        // Get the current state
        getState() {
            return state;
        },
        // Subscribe a listener to state changes
        subscribe(listener) {
            listeners.push(listener);
            return () => {
                const index = listeners.indexOf(listener);
                listeners.splice(index, 1);
            };
        },
    };
}
```

### Script to Demonstrate Usage (script.js)
Demonstrated the store's functionality with various scenarios.
```javascript
import { actionTypes } from './action.js';
import { reducer } from './reducer.js';
import { createStore } from './store.js';

// Create the store
const store = createStore(reducer);

// Subscribe to state changes and log them
store.subscribe(() => {
    console.log('State updated:', store.getState());
});

// Scenario 1: Initial State Verification
console.log('Scenario 1: Initial State Verification');
console.log(store.getState()); // Expected output: { count: 0 }

// Scenario 2: Incrementing the Counter
console.log('Scenario 2: Incrementing the Counter');
store.dispatch({ type: actionTypes.INCREMENT });
store.dispatch({ type: actionTypes.INCREMENT });
console.log(store.getState()); // Expected output: { count: 2 }

// Scenario 3: Decrementing the Counter
console.log('Scenario 3: Decrementing the Counter');
store.dispatch({ type: actionTypes.DECREMENT });
console.log(store.getState()); // Expected output: { count: 1 }

// Scenario 4: Resetting the Counter
console.log('Scenario 4: Resetting the Counter');
store.dispatch({ type: actionTypes.RESET });
console.log(store.getState()); // Expected output: { count: 0 }
```

### HTML File to Include Script (index.html)
The minimal HTML setup to run the script.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <script src="script.js" type="module"></script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

## User Stories
- **Initial State Verification**: Confirms the initial state is `{ count: 0 }`.
- **Incrementing the Counter**: Increments the counter twice, resulting in `{ count: 2 }`.
- **Decrementing the Counter**: Decrements the counter, resulting in `{ count: 1 }`.
- **Resetting the Counter**: Resets the counter, resulting in `{ count: 0 }`.

## Challenges Faced
During the implementation of this project, I encountered a few challenges:
1. **Ensuring State Immutability**: Managing state immutably was crucial to avoid unintended side effects. This required careful design of the reducer function to always return a new state object.
2. **Functional Programming Principles**: Sticking to functional programming principles, such as using pure functions and avoiding mutations, helped in creating a predictable state management system but required a mindset shift from imperative programming practices.
3. **Minimalistic Implementation**: Striving for simplicity while ensuring functionality was a delicate balance. It was tempting to add more features, but the focus was on meeting the core requirements effectively.

## Lessons Learned
This project reinforced several key concepts:
1. **Importance of Immutability**: Immutability in state management helps in maintaining predictable and traceable state changes, making debugging easier.
2. **Functional Programming**: Applying functional programming principles, such as pure functions and immutability, leads to more maintainable and testable code.
3. **Observer Pattern**: Implementing the observer pattern through the `subscribe` method highlighted the power of decoupling state management from UI rendering.
4. **Simplicity and Focus**: Focusing on core functionalities without overcomplicating the implementation is crucial for clarity and maintainability.

## Conclusion
This implementation demonstrates efficient state management without UI rendering, highlighting the core principles of a Redux-inspired store. It was an insightful exercise in applying functional programming concepts to create a simple yet effective state management solution.
